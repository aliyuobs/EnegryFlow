## Smart Contract

The EnergyFlow smart contract (`energy-flow.clar`) manages all trading operations and includes:

### Core Functions
- `list-energy`: List energy for sale
- `delist-energy`: Remove energy from marketplace
- `purchase-energy`: Execute energy purchase
- `return-energy`: Process energy returns
- `get-energy-balance`: Check user's energy balance
- `get-token-balance`: Check user's token balance

### Administrative Functions
- `update-unit-price`: Update energy unit price
- `update-platform-fee`: Modify platform fee
- `update-return-rate`: Adjust return rate
- `update-system-capacity`: Set system capacity limits

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks Wallet
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- Clarinet for smart contract development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energyflow.git
cd energyflow
```

2. Install dependencies:
